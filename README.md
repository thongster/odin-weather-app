# odin-weather-app

The Weather App project from The Odin Project's Javascript course

This was the first time I've worked with promises, async/await, and grabbing data from an API. 

Although the project is actually quite basic, I had quite a lot of fun learning about promises and async/await because now I can actually get data from a live data source online! Definitely opens up the possibilities for further projects.

There weren't any major issues I encountered with this project as it is overall quite simple. Mostly just figuring out the syntax for async/await, try/catch, and figuring out how the weather API was structured.

The design is also quite basic but I made sure to work with some media queries for responsiveness.
